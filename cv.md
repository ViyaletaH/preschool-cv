##### About Me
*****
I am a 23 years old junior developer looking for the best ways to use my knowledges  and get the experience, i desire.
The ambitiousness and the sense of purpose are caused by the maximalism, corresponding to my age. 
At the same time, coupled with the above-mentioned, such personality traits, as compliance and assiduity, entail the high efficiency of work.  It is the time I work on the creation of my expertise, to make it the basis of my professional qualities, that is why I can be easily imbed into the structure of an organization and develop in the priority direction for the job.  
I have worked as a brand manager for two years before i decided to change my life and concentrate on the new sphere. My former jobplace allowed me to polish my English and communicating skills, as far as i was to contact with foringer suppliers every day.
